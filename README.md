# F1FantasyData 

Price data from the F1 fantasy game. This data is gathered using the
[F1FantasyScraper](https://github.com/EduardoFAFernandes/F1FantasyScraper)
and it's run by GitHub actions.

This repository contains two F1 seasons 2021 and 2022. The 2021 season is very
incomplete because I was the one hosting the data scraping on my raspberry-pi.

The 2022 season is now in full swing and hopefully by using GitHub actions it
will be much more stable and reliable.
